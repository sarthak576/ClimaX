# Hydration Mismatch Error in Next.js

## Error Description


This error occurs when there's a mismatch between server-rendered HTML and client-side React hydration.

## Common Causes

### 1. Server/Client State Differences
- Using `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')` conditions
- Variable inputs like `Date.now()` or `Math.random()`
- Locale-specific formatting (dates, numbers) that differs between server and client

### 2. Dynamic Content Issues
- External data changes between server render and client hydration
- Browser extensions modifying DOM before React hydration
- Invalid HTML tag nesting

### 3. Style Mismatches
- Dynamic styles/classes applied differently on server and client
- CSS-in-JS libraries generating different class names

## Solutions

### 🛠️ General Fixes

```javascript
// 1. Mark client-only components explicitly
"use client";

// 2. Move dynamic operations to useEffect
useEffect(() => {
  // Client-side only code
}, []);
